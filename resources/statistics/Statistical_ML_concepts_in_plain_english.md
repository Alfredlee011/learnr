## Motivation 
##### Being from the CS department, I'm often confused with statistical terms and sometimes with machine learning terms too. Looks like, I'm still in the learning phase and have lots to learn while time runs short. So to save myself the hassle of time constraint and searching the internet for my questions, I have decided to maintain this markdown to serve as my one stop destination. In this file, I will maintain a list of great answers that I have found to be easy on my "grey cells". This repository will also serve as my weekend readings.
